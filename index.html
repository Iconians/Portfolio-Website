      <h2>The Development Process</h2>

    </div>
    <div class="dev-process-body">
      <div>
        <h3>1st Step</h3>
        <p>
          The first step in the development process which is probably the hardest is to sit down and figure out what kind of 
          website you want, if you want a landing page with a few pieces of content or a website that has multiple pages,
          then you need to decide how you want your site to look (the layout) making a sketch is helpful when trying to visualize,
          then when you sit down with me we can refine the sketch and if you need further help in finding the right layout you can 
          visit different sites you like and look at how the content is layed out which can help you figure what layout you like 
          then of course I as the technical partner can assist you in refining the sketch and bounce ideas around.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>2nd Step</h3>
        <p>
          The second step in the process is scheduling a free initial meeting with the me (the technical partner) which will last 10 to 15 minutes,
          which we will discuss an overview of your project and decide if we will work well together, then we will set up a free 45 min to 
          an hour meeting and dig into the project and figure out all the nuts and bolts and put it down on paper and signed, at this
          point the initial payment is due to start development process.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>3rd Step</h3>
        <p>
          the third step is the actual development, this is where I look over the sketch and divide the sketch into sections and group 
          content based on location and other commonalities, then think about what tools to use that make the most sense when the site 
          is viewed on a phone or tablet since most responsive tools are built into the desktop version of the site then as the screen
          gets smaller like on a tablet or phone there will only be minimal adjustments needed, then I build the site out and will send
          a picture to the client for their feedback and then will implement their adjustments and once the client is satisfied I will 
          upload the site to the clients server   
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>4th Step</h3>
        <p>
          the fourth step is collect final payment if there is one and for the client to decide if they wish to keep me as their technical
          partner for future website updates

       <h2>Clayton Cripe</h2>
       <p>
          Hello my name is Clayton Cripe, let me tell you a little about my background in technology, as most 90's kids I grew up around
          computers whether it was a desktop or a game console which means growing up I self taught myself a lot about computers and found I
          had a knack in understanding computers and fixing them when something went wrong so I ended up being the IT guy in my family then 
          as I got older I took some schooling and became more proficient with computers, then I decided recently to specialize in creating 
          websites and took a course to help me get a good foundation which now I am ready to put my extensive knowledge at your disposal in 
          creating you an eye catching website and fulfilling whatever technical needs you may have in the future as I am looking to fill the 
          role of your technical partner that way you can focus on what you do best  
       </p>
