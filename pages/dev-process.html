          <h3>1st Step</h3>
          <p>
            The first step in the development process which is probably the hardest is to sit down and figure out what kind of 
            website you want, if you want a landing page with a few pieces of content or a website that has multiple pages,
            then you need to decide how you want your site to look (the layout) making a sketch is helpful when trying to visualize,
            then when you sit down with me we can refine the sketch. if you need further help in finding the right layout you can 
            visit different sites you like and look at how the content is layed out. Which can help you figure what layout you like, 
            then of course I as the technical partner can assist you in refining the sketch and bounce ideas around.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="dev-process-content">
          <h3>2nd Step</h3>
          <p>
            The second step in the process is scheduling a free initial meeting with me (the technical partner) which will last 10 to 15 minutes,
            which we will discuss an overview of your project and decide that we will proceed forward together. Then we will set up a free 45 min to 
            an hour meeting and dig into the project and go over the pictures/graphics, headings, paragraphs, links you want to include from other sites. 
            Then put it down on paper and sign, at this point the initial payment is due to start development process.

        <div class="dev-process-content">
          <h3>3rd Step</h3>
          <p>
            the third step is the actual development, this is where I look over the sketch and divide the sketch into sections and group 
            content based on location and other commonalities, then think about what tools to use that make the most sense when the site 
            is viewed on a phone or tablet since most responsive tools are built into the desktop version of the site. Then as the screen
            gets smaller like on a tablet or phone there will be adjustments needed, then I build the site out and will send
            a picture to the client for their feedback and then will implement their adjustments and once the client is satisfied I will 
            upload the site to the clients server

        <div class="dev-process-content">
          <h3>4th Step</h3>
          <p>
            The fourth step is collect final payment if there is one and the client can decide to keep me as their technical partner for future website updates.
